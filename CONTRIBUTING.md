Notes:
  - [generate.py](generate.py) was created to manage pulling updates as Uptrends updates
    their API. TODO: Add automation to run generate.py when a polling operation detects
    updates to the Uptrends API.
  - To comply with library regeneration, all updates to the library (bugfixes,
    enhancements, etc.) should be added to [generate.py](generate.py) or some other
    change script that is run after regeneration.

TODO:
  - Add versioning to keep track of updates to Uptrends API
